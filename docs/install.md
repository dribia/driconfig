## Installation

### Using uv (recommended)
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a fast Python package installer and resolver.

```shell
uv pip install driconfig
```

Or add it to your project:

```shell
uv add driconfig
```

### Using pip
Installation is as simple as:
```shell
pip install driconfig
```

### Dependencies
DriConfig heavily depends on two other Python libraries,
that will be installed as dependencies:

* [**Pydantic**](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) is a _data validation framework using Python type annotations._
* [**PyYAML**](https://pyyaml.org/) is _a full-featured YAML framework for the Python programming language._
